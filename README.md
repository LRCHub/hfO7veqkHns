[00:02.37] Catching flights, not feelings
[00:04.03] I'm not tryna hurt myself, tryna burn myself
[00:07.74] Catching flights, not feelings (yeah, uh)
[00:09.13] I'm not tryna hurt myself, tryna burn myself (yeah)
[00:34.63] 
[00:12.28] 모두가 잠들어 있는 night off
[00:14.95] 창문을 두드려 깨운 목소리
[00:18.29] 하늘에 떠 있는 strange plane
[00:19.94] 내가 말하면 어디든 데려가 줄래 hey, look
[00:33.44] 
[00:23.10] Every day, 넘치는 마음에 (yeah)
[00:25.68] I'm so fly, yeah, yeah, I bring it back (yeah)
[00:28.58] 이젠 내 맘에 솔직할래
[00:30.38] I wanna get out, I wanna try, I wanna escape
[00:52.38] 
[00:33.71] Oh, I tried to warn you
[00:37.53] 이젠 내 멋대로, let it flow
[00:48.03] 
[00:44.17] Catching flights, not feelings
[00:45.77] I'm not tryna hurt myself, tryna burn myself
[00:49.47] Catching flights, not feelings
[00:50.91] I'm not tryna hurt myself, wanna earn it, earn it
[00:54.25] 저 구름 너머 (너머), 끝까지 내 맘을 펼쳐 (펼쳐)
[01:02.33] I'm flying over the moon
[01:14.33] 
[01:04.78] 선명해진 나의 맘이, you see?
[01:07.31] 방향키를 잡아 다시, for me
[01:09.65] Yeah, 곤두세운 감각, 엉켜 있는 my life
[01:12.88] Damn, it's hard 풀어 놔 fly high
[01:27.38] 
[01:15.23] (One, two, three) Ex to be exact
[01:17.80] (One, two, three) Yeah, 즐기면 돼 (yeah)
[01:20.65] 갇혀 있던 내 감정의 maze
[01:22.66] I wanna get out, I wanna try, I wanna escape
[01:44.66] 
[01:25.91] Oh, I tried to warn you
[01:29.78] 이 바람을 느껴, let it flow
[01:40.28] 
[01:36.37] Catching flights, not feelings
[01:37.89] I'm not tryna hurt myself, tryna burn myself
[01:41.51] Catching flights, not feelings
[01:43.11] I'm not tryna hurt myself, wanna earn it, earn it
[01:46.53] 저 구름 너머 (끝없이), 끝까지 내 맘을 펼쳐 (맘을 펼쳐, 펼쳐)
[01:54.60] I'm flying over the moon
[02:06.60] 
[01:57.07] 삼킬 듯한, 내 그림잔, 저 멀리 점이 됐지
[02:02.33] 두려움과, 걱정은 right, 훌훌 다 털어 버려
[02:07.74] 길 없는 지도를 펼쳐 난
[02:11.56] 그저 맘이 흘러가는 곳으로 flying now
[02:24.06] 
[02:18.10] Catching flights, not feelings
[02:19.71] I'm not tryna hurt myself, tryna burn myself
[02:23.34] Catching flights, not feelings
[02:24.91] I'm not tryna hurt myself, wanna earn it, earn it
[02:28.34] 긴 밤의 저편 (날아봐), 새롭게 내 맘을 펼쳐 (나를 펼쳐, 펼쳐)
[02:36.42] I'm flying over the moon
[02:48.42] 
[02:38.18] You should catch a flight, not the feels, yuh
[02:40.52] You should catch a flight, not the feels, yuh
[02:43.24] You should catch a flight, not the feelings, ah
[02:45.82] Not the feelings, ah, not the feelings
[02:47.83] Not the feelings, yeah, hey, mm-hm
