모두가 잠들어 있는
Night off
창문을 두드려
깨운 목소리
하늘에 떠 있는
Strange plane
내가 말하면 어디든
데려가 줄래
Hey Look

Every day
넘치는 마음에
I'm so fly
Yeah Yeah
I bring it back
이젠 내 맘에
솔직할래
I wanna get out
I wanna try
I wanna escape

Catching Flights, Not Feelings
I'm not tryna hurt myself
Tryna burn myself

Catching Flights, Not Feelings
I'm not tryna hurt myself
Wanna earn it, earn it

Catching Flights, Not Feelings
I'm not tryna hurt myself

선명해진 나의 맘이
You see?
방향키를 잡아 다시
For me
Yeah 곤두세운 감각
엉켜 있는 My life
Damn,
It's hard 풀어 놔
Fly high

1, 2, 3
Ex to be exact
1, 2, 3
Yeah 즐기면 돼
갇혀 있던 내
감정의 Maze
I wanna get out
I wanna try
I wanna escape

Oh
I tried to warn you
이젠 내 멋대로, let it flow, whoa, whoa, oh

Oh
I tried to warn you
이 바람을 느껴
Let it flow, whoa, whoa, oh

Catching Flights, Not Feelings
I'm not tryna hurt myself
Tryna burn myself

Catching Flights, Not Feelings
I'm not tryna hurt myself
Wanna earn it, earn it

Catching Flights, Not Feelings
I'm not tryna hurt myself
Tryna burn myself

Catching Flights, Not Feelings
I'm not tryna hurt myself
